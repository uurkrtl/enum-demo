Coding: Enum
Create a new project in IntelliJ and implement the following steps.

Step 1: Create an enum DaysOfWeek with the weekdays (Monday to Sunday).
Step 2: Write a method that returns the passed weekday as a string if it is a weekday (Monday to Friday), otherwise return 'Weekend'.
Step 3: Create a record 'Person' with the properties 'id', 'name', and 'favoriteDay', where 'favoriteDay' is of type DaysOfWeek.
Step 4: Create a class PersonRepository with a list/map of persons.
Step 5: Write a method in the class PersonRepository that searches for and returns a person based on their id from the list/map. The method should return an Optional.
Step 6: In your main method, check if the person exists. If they do, print the name and favorite day of the week to the console.
