## Coding: Enum

Create a new project in IntelliJ and implement the following steps.

-   Step 1: Create an enum  `DaysOfWeek`  with the weekdays (Monday to Sunday).
-   Step 2: Write a method that returns the passed weekday as a string if it is a weekday (Monday to Friday), otherwise return 'Weekend'.
-   Step 3: Create a record 'Person' with the properties 'id', 'name', and 'favoriteDay', where 'favoriteDay' is of type  `DaysOfWeek`.
-   Step 4: Create a class  `PersonRepository`  with a list/map of persons.
-   Step 5: Write a method in the class  `PersonRepository`  that searches for and returns a person based on their id from the list/map. The method should return an Optional.
-   Step 6: In your main method, check if the person exists. If they do, print the name and favorite day of the week to the console.
-   If you have already completed this task earlier, you may work on the bonus task on the next page.

If you want, you can work on this optional bonus task.

-   Add a method in the  `PersonRepository`  that searches and returns a person by their name. The method should return an Optional.
-   Write a method in the  `PersonRepository`  that searches and returns all persons by their favorite weekday. The method should return a list.
